The input to the algorithm are two images which are related by an unknown transformation. I used the blobs detector implemented to extract keypoints and extract feature descriptors on them. Then estimated an affine transformation using feature matching and RANSAC to produce a combined image.","link":"https://github.com/Astuary/PanoramicStitching","id":"9b782f94-8e1f-57dc-b10b-6733a26de438"}},{"node":{"title":"Texture Synthesis","subtitle":"A simple approach for generating a texture is to randomly tile the target image using patches from a source image. It results in an image with artifacts around the edge of the tiles. This is because the tiles do not align well. The approach of Efros and Leung avoids this by generating the ouput, one pixel at a time, by matching the local neighborhood of the pixel in the generated image and source image. The random tiling approach works reasonably well for some textures and is much faster than the pixel-by-pixel synthesis approach. However, it may have visible artifacts at the border. The “Image Quilting” approach from Efros and Freeman, proposes a way to minimize these by picking tiles that align well along the boundary (like solving a jigsaw puzzle).","link":"https://github.com/Astuary/TextureSynthesis","id":"19db2b72-0c5f-50aa-95f2-f194cd63eb78"}},{"node":{"title":"Blob Detection","subtitle":"Built a Laplacian scale space, starting with some initial scale and going for n iterations.
