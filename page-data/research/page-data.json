That is, there should be no linguistic difference between real and fake message, without revealing the structure of the real message. I employ natural language processing and generalized differential privacy to solve this problem.","link":"https://github.com/Astuary/ResearchPapers/blob/main/HEwithLanguageModel.pdf","date":"May 2020","id":"29639267-9a23-52fb-97cb-f3b2b911c716"}},{"node":{"title":"Improved Algorithm for Seamlessly Creating Infinite Loops from a Video Clip, while Preserving Variety in Textures","subtitle":"Video to GIF seamless transform with max amount of varied frames - improve distance metric by switching from a crude sum of squared distance to most sophisticated wavelet-based distance; add intensity normalization, cross-fading and morphing to the suggested basic algorithm.
