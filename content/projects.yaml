- title: Skin Cancer Detection
  subtitle: Modified mobilenet to detect 4 types of skin cancer-- Basal Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Melanoma, Malignant Melanoma, and Banal Moles. Used Matlab Image Processing Toolbox to augment the ISIC dataset.

- title: Image Denoising
  subtitle: Evaluated two simple denoising algorithms, namely Gaussian filtering and median filtering. In addition, also implemented a more advanced algorithm based on nonlocal means.

- title: Depth from Disparity
  subtitle: Used a pair of images to compute a depth image of the scene. I did this by computing a disparity map. A disparity map is an image that stores the displacement that leads every pixel in an image X to its corresponding pixel in the image. The depth image is inversely proportional to the disparity.

- title: Robotics Class Projects
  subtitle: Implemented three different image representations for MNIST dataset-- Raw Pixels, Histogram of Gradients and Local Binary Patterns

- title: Panoramic Stitching
  subtitle: Implemented the RANSAC algorithm to stitch two images. The input to the algorithm are two images which are related by an unknown transformation. I used the blobs detector implemented to extract keypoints and extract feature descriptors on them. Then estimated an affine transformation using feature matching and RANSAC to produce a combined image.

- title: Texture Synthesis
  subtitle: A simple approach for generating a texture is to randomly tile the target image using patches from a source image. It results in an image with artifacts around the edge of the tiles. This is because the tiles do not align well. The approach of Efros and Leung avoids this by generating the ouput, one pixel at a time, by matching the local neighborhood of the pixel in the generated image and source image. The random tiling approach works reasonably well for some textures and is much faster than the pixel-by-pixel synthesis approach. However, it may have visible artifacts at the border. The “Image Quilting” approach from Efros and Freeman, proposes a way to minimize these by picking tiles that align well along the boundary (like solving a jigsaw puzzle).

- title: Video to seamless GIFs
  subtitle: From the original Microsoft paper on "Video Textures", here the goal was to improve distance metric by switching from a crude sum of squared distance to most sophisticated wavelet-based distance; add intensity normalization, cross-fading and morphing to the suggested basic algorithm. We also experiment on the trade-off between variety and smoothness.
